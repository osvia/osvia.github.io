Our team went underground at the German Mining Museum to explore massive, century-old machinery and learn about 200 years of mining history in the Ruhr region—all while escaping the summer heat above. The guided tour through the replica coal pits was both fascinating and refreshingly cool. Back in the museum halls, interactive exhibits showcased the evolution of mining technology and its impact on the region. It was a memorable day that combined hands-on history with a welcome break from the office.
