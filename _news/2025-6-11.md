We were delighted to host Dr. Maryam Haghighat from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Robotics at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, for a two-week research visit in June. Dr. Haghighat joined our team to collaborate on ongoing research projects.
<br><br>
During her visit, Dr. Haghighat presented her latest findings on self-supervised learning strategies and transformer-based models that generalize well across different domains and scales – from the microscopic complexity of medical imaging to large-scale perception in remote sensing with hyperspectral data, as well as robotics using LiDAR point clouds.

The visit proved to be both productive and inspiring, strengthening international ties and paving the way for future collaboration. We are grateful for the opportunity to learn from Dr. Haghighat and look forward to the next steps in our partnership.
