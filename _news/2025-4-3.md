On April 3, as part of Girls' Day, two groups of schoolgirls visited us. Highlights included a vehicle simulator, AI-based gesture recognition and an image puzzle to differentiate between real and AI-generated images and interacting with our team. They were able to use the software themselves and experience live how machine learning and applied mathematics work in research. We are delighted with the high level of interest and hope that this insight will awaken the desire to study our subject later on.
