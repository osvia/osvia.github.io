On February 7, 2025, a joint workshop with Control Expert took place at Campus Freudenberg. The event provided a platform for exchange between industry partners and our research team.
<br><br>
<b>Presentations by Control Expert</b><br>
Control Expert contributed to the workshop with three main topics:
<br><br>
Application of agent systems for liability assessment in motor claims settlement
<br><br>
Efficient learning of multimodal models
<br><br>
Fraud detection for documents
<br><br>
<b>Our research contributions</b><br>
Our team presented current projects that reflect the broad spectrum of our research work:
<br><br>
Benchmarking Texture Bias in Image Classifiers using Edge-Enhancing Diffusion
arxiv.org/abs/2402.09530
<br><br>
Uncertainty and Prediction Quality Estimation for Semantic Segmentation via Graph Neural Networks
arxiv.org/abs/2409.11373
<br><br>
Texture and Color in Semantic Segmentation
arxiv.org/abs/2410.14878
<br><br>
In addition to our team, Junior Professor Kira Maag from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf ([LINK]) presented another research topic as a guest:
<br><br>
False Negative Reduction under Domain Shift and Out-of-Distribution Segmentation
arxiv.org/abs/2207.03513
<br><br>
<b>Exchange and outlook</b><br>
In addition to the presentations, there were intensive discussions and further presentations of posters and ideas from the junior research group. Catering provider Myrbach provided the catering, which was very well received by the participants.
<br><br>
We would like to thank Control Expert and all participants for the constructive exchange and look forward to continuing this promising partnership.
