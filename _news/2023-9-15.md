Since September 2023, Sarina Penquitt and Matthias Rottmann are officially associated members of the DataNinjas.
<br><br>
It is a research training group hosted at the CoR-Lab in Bielefeld University and connects leading research groups in AI in North Rhine-Westphalia. Our associated project „Dory: Data-Centric AI for Data Quality Assessment“ focuses on examining and understanding the data. Finding anomalous examples in datasets, in terms of untypical constellations in feature space or in terms of incorrect labels, is our main research goal.
