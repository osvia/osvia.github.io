[1] „Towards Rapid Prototyping and Comparability in Active Learning for Deep Object Detection“ by T. Riedlinger, M. Schubert, K. Kahl, H. Gottschalk, M. Rottmann
This work provides a sandbox environment that allows rapid prototyping of active learning methods for object detection, saving up to a factor of 32 in computational time. This is complemented by useful evaluation metrics, baselines for comparison, and baseline results on PascalVOC and BDD100k that can be reused by the community.

[2] „Deep Active Learning with Noisy Oracle in Object Detection“ by M. Schubert, T. Riedlinger, K. Kahl, M. Rottmann
During our work on [1], we realized that label quality plays a particularly important role in situations where only small amounts of training data are available. We combine AI-guided label checking with simple uncertainty-guided data selection and show that
<br><br>
1) label checking significantly improves model performance (as a function of labeling effort) and
<br><br>
2) uncertainty-guided data selection and label checking are indeed synergistic.
