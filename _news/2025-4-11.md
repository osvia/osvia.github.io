On April 11, 2025, the Just Scan It 3D project held its second meeting at the German Mining Museum (Deutsches Bergbaumuseum) in Bochum, hosted by Professor Michael Prange and the museum itself. Our team, along with all other project participants, gathered for a productive day.

Beyond crucial project updates, attendees experienced tangible demonstrations from individual partners. Highlights included the latest progress on the project's user-friendly app, designed for capturing objects for 3D modeling, and initial results of Gaussian Splatting object reconstruction. Fittingly for the venue, we showcased this technology with drone footage of a mining headframe.

The day's highlight was an exclusive private tour deep into the museum's underground mining tunnels. The event concluded perfectly with a taste of regional culture: authentic "Currywurst" from the Ruhr region.
