Today we supported the girlsday 2023 with a number of curious and enthusiastic girls. We presented our driving simulator where they could experience how an AI perceives its environment, a camera-based pose estimation, clustering algorithms were executed with pen and paper and the girls learned to distinguish real images from fake ones created by a generative AI.
