Sarina Penquitt and Matthias Rottmann (associated DataNinjas) participated at the DataNinja sAIOnARA 2024 conference from June 25th to June 27th, 2024 at Bielefeld University.

The DataNinjas are a research training group hosted at the CoR-Lab of Bielefeld University and connects leading AI research groups in North Rhine-Westphalia. In the poster session, we had the pleasure to present our paper „LMD: Light-weight Prediction Quality Estimation for Object Detection in Lidar Point Clouds“ (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-54605-1_6), which deals with uncertainty quantification in Lidar point cloud based object detection. An application presented in the paper is the detection of label errors in Lidar-based object detection datasets. Label error detection is also the key contribution of the University of Wuppertal to the DataNinja project. We had great three days in Bielefeld!
