The OSVIA lab joined a scientific workshop hosted at ControlExpert together with the research team of Prof. Kira Maag from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf and colleagues from ControlExpert.
<br><br>
We discussed uncertainty quantification for modern AI systems, covering topics such as detection and segmentation in computer vision, foundation models, and calibration of large language model outputs. A recurring point throughout the workshop was that uncertainty matters in practice because it helps make clear when an AI system is confident enough to automate a step and when human review is the better option.
<br><br>
The exchange connected current research with real operational needs in claims and repair processes, where more reliable uncertainty estimates can improve automation quality, decision-making, and measurable process outcomes.

Thank you to everyone involved for the constructive discussions and to ControlExpert for organizing and hosting the workshop.
