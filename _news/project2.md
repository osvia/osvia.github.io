The collaboration between Niko Suenderhauf, Dimity Miller from Queensland University of Technology, our colleague Annika Mütze and Matthias Rottmann has been selected for funding by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). A series of visits between Brisbane, Australia and Wuppertal, Germany will expand our collaboration in exploring the frontiers of foundation models in computer vision. We are very excited and look forward to a new scientific journey.
