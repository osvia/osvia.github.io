The German Research Foundation (DFG) has approved funding for a new research project led by Matthias Rottmann at Osnabrück University. The project, titled “Unified Uncertainty Estimation for Fine-tuned Open-Vocabulary Models in Image Classification and Object Detection,” aims to make modern AI systems more reliable and transparent when operating in open-world environments.
<br><br>
Building on recent advances in foundation models such as CLIP and Grounding DINO, the research will develop new methods to quantify and interpret uncertainty in AI-based image understanding. This will help AI systems recognize when they are unsure — a key capability for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving or medical imaging.
<br><br>
Over the next three years, the project will design and evaluate novel techniques that combine deep learning with generative models like stable diffusion to create realistic “out-of-context” examples (see Figure). These synthetic samples will be used to train AI systems that can better handle unknown objects and situations. A particular focus lies on transferring these capabilities to smaller, efficient object detectors that can operate on limited hardware, extending the applicability of reliable AI to real-world settings.
<br><br>
Starting on January 1, 2026, the project will open new avenues toward safer, more transparent, and more responsible applications of machine learning in the years to come.
