He provided a comprehensive overview of his research in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular Deep Learning, and his development of methods to make AI more reliable and efficient. This included methods to equip AI for the unknown. An AI works with a fixed number of categories (figuratively speaking, drawers) and sorts all observations into them. Among other things, Rottmann teaches the AI to say "No": "I cannot assign this object to any of the categories. At the University of Wuppertal, Rottmann works with a team of currently nine PhD students on both basic and applied projects. As deputy spokesperson of the Interdisciplinary Center for Machine Learning and Data Analytics, he will continue to drive forward his faculty's activities in the field of AI.
