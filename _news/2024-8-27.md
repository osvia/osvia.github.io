title: "OOD Detection: Limits of Open-Vocabulary Object Detectors"
date: 2024-8-27
summary: Up to now, there has only been a limited number of scientific works on how to teach object detection systems to detect unknown objects, so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, e.g. objects that typically do not appear in street scenes.

Up to now, there has only been a limited number of scientific works on how to teach object detection systems to detect unknown objects, so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, e.g. objects that typically do not appear in street scenes.

Recently, open-vocabulary object detectors like grounding Dino have achieved stunning object detection capabilities in open-world computer vision. Their frontiers are not well-explored, yet. In her recent preprint, Sadia Ilyas studies whether open-vocabulary object detectors have silently solved OOD object detection. Little spoiler: they did not!

If you want to learn more, her preprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11221. She will present her work at the ECCV2024 OODCV workshop.
