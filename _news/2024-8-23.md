Today we had a wonderful workshop at dSPACE with the team of Nikolas Hemion.
<br><br>
What a great atmosphere and a fruitful exchange! Thank you Kamil Kowol for organizing this event and thank you to the whole team for making this event happen! Topics that we focused on were the detection of label errors in datasets, LLMs for scenario generation, and biases in neural networks. This was complemented with the right amount of a technology show.
