<meta name="description" content="The OSVIA lab joined a scientific workshop hosted at ControlExpert together with the research team of Prof. Kira Maag from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf and colleagues from ControlExpert.  We discussed uncertainty quantification for modern AI systems, covering topics such as detection and segmentation in computer vision, foundation models, and calibration of large language model outputs. A recurring point throughout the workshop was that uncertainty matters in practice because it helps make clear when an AI system is confident enough to automate a step and when human review is the better option.  The exchange connected current research with real operational needs in claims and repair processes, where more reliable uncertainty estimates can improve automation quality, decision-making, and measurable process outcomes.  Thank you to everyone involved for the constructive discussions and to ControlExpert for organizing and hosting the workshop.">
