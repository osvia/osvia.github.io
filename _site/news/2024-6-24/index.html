<meta name="description" content="The ACM AI Lab, part of the Interdisciplinary Center for Machine Learning and Data Analytics (IZMD), took part in the University of Wuppertal’s summer fest. This event provided an excellent opportunity for our team to showcase innovative projects and actively engage with the university community. Additionally, we shared our booth with the TMDT, further enriching the experience with a diverse array of technological demonstrations.  Our primary objectives were to introduce our team to a wider audience, foster connections, and spark interest in the field of artificial intelligence. To achieve these goals, we presented several interactive demonstrations.  The main attraction at our booth was a driving simulator equipped with AI vision technology. Visitors experienced firsthand how AI vision systems, particularly semantic segmentation, operate. This hands-on demo was both entertaining and educational, illustrating practical AI applications.  Additionally, we featured a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) puzzle game, which further engaged visitors and demonstrated the creative potential of AI.  Throughout the day, we enjoyed conversing with many fascinating individuals from diverse backgrounds. These interactions allowed us to share insights about our team’s work and discuss the broader implications of AI technology. It was inspiring to witness the curiosity and enthusiasm of the attendees, many of whom expressed a keen interest in learning more about our research.  Overall, our participation in the University of Wuppertal’s summer fest was a rewarding experience. We highlighted the innovative projects of the ACM AI Lab, engaged with the university community, and contributed to the lively atmosphere of the event. We look forward to future opportunities to showcase our work and continue fostering interest in the exciting field of artificial intelligence.">
