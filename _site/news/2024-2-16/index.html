The event served as an excellent platform to discuss current topics and challenges in the ever-evolving tech landscape and to see inspiring applications of AI for motor claims.  The session with 5 oral presentations focused on introducing innovative concepts that improve either quality or efficiency of AI technologies. We were treated to thought-provoking presentations that not only pushed the boundaries of our understanding but also sparked engaging discussions among the attendees.  The live demo and poster session were the cherries on top, providing hands-on experiences and detailed discussions on the practical applications of these technologies. We left the exchange feeling inspired and energized, with fresh perspectives on how we can leverage machine learning and AI to tackle real-world problems.  A special thanks goes to Dr. Sebastian Schoenen and the Research and Development team of ControlExpert, as well as to all the speakers for their valuable contributions.
